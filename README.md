In our project where we used MSSQL as the database, the backend part was coded entirely with API. In the frontend part, the API structure was consumed with the MVC controller.

Here are some structures and Technologies used in the Project:



- Repository Design Pattern

- N Tier Architecture

- Asp.Net Core Identity

- Rapid API

- Json Web Token

- Entity Framework Core

- Email Sending Procedures

- Fluent Validation
